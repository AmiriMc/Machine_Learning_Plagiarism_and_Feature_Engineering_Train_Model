# Plagiarism Detection, Feature Engineering (Data Science, Machine Learning)

Application that uses Python, AWS SageMaker, Amazon S3 and SciKit-Learn to compare student answers to
questions about Google to source answers and decides whether or not the student answer plagiarized the
source answer. This project is from Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree program.
