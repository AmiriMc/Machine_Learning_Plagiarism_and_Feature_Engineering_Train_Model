0,g0pA_taska.txt,a,0,0,inheritance is a basic concept of object oriented programming where the basic idea is to create new classes that add extra detail to existing classes this is done by allowing the new classes to reuse the methods and variables of the existing classes and new methods and classes are added to specialise the new class inheritance models the is kind of relationship between entities or objects  for example postgraduates and undergraduates are both kinds of student this kind of relationship can be visualised as a tree structure where student would be the more general root node and both postgraduate and undergraduate would be more specialised extensions of the student node or the child nodes  in this relationship student would be known as the superclass or parent class whereas  postgraduate would be known as the subclass or child class because the postgraduate class extends the student class  inheritance can occur on several layers where if visualised would display a larger tree structure for example we could further extend the postgraduate node by adding two extra extended classes to it called  msc student and phd student as both these types of student are kinds of postgraduate student this would mean that both the msc student and phd student classes would inherit methods and variables from both the postgraduate and student classes  ,train

4,g0pA_taske.txt,e,0,0,dynamic programming is an algorithm design technique used for optimisation problems such as minimising or maximising like divide and conquer dynamic programming solves problems by combining solutions to sub problems however unlike divide and conquer sub problems are not always independent as sub problems may share sub sub problems but solution to one sub problem may not affect the solutions to other sub problems of the same problem  there are four steps in dynamic programming  1 characterise structure of an optimal solution  2 define value of optimal solution recursively  3 compute optimal solution values either top down with caching or bottom up in a table  4 construct an optimal solution from computed values  an example of the type of problem for which dynamic programming may be used is given two sequences x x1 xm and y y1 yn find a common subsequence whose length is maximum  dynamic programming reduces computation by solving sub problems in a bottom up fashion and by storing solution to a sub problem the first time it is solved also looking up the solution when a sub problem is encountered again helps reduce computation however the key in dynamic programming is to determine the structure of optimal solutions  ,train

64,g3pA_taske.txt,e,0,0,in the field of computer science term dynamic programming relates to the style of programming that breaks a large problem down into smaller subproblems and generally allows for the finding of the optimal solution when the problem is split into subproblems these themselves may be split into smaller problems and so on until they cannot be reduced any more it is also common for dynamic programming to make use of recursion and the saving of previous results for faster computation later this also leads to higher efficiency as calculations are not being redone for example when a problem is reduced into sub problems and those are then reduced further it may be that there are common subsubproblems and so only one calculation needs to be done and the result saved to help solve more than one subproblem an example of this gain in efficiency is a path finding problem if there are two distinct routes in a network of 10 nodes tagged a to j then if the two routes share a common section say between nodes b and d  the cost of that section should be calculated for the first route and saved then when the second route is being processed the cost of b to d does not need to be calculated again in general dynamic programming is used on optimisation problems where the most efficient solution is needed areas where this sort of programming is useful is in ai computer graphics compression routines and biomedical applications ,train
65,g3pB_taska.txt,a,0,0,inheritance is a concept in object oriented programming where a child or sub class inherits characteristics from a parent or super class  the concept takes its name from genetic inheritance where a child can inherit genetic characteristics from its parents  inheritance at its simplest allows programmers to model a relationship where one object is a kind of another  for instance two classes one representing an undergraduate student and another representing a post graduate student could both be said to belong to a more generalised class representing all students  similarly we could say that dogs and cats are two kinds of animal or that bridges and skyscrapers are two types of man made structure  subclasses are said to extend or specialise their superclasses  attributes variables and behaviours functions that are common between classes can be included in the definition of the superclass leaving the subclass definitions containing only the attributes and behaviours that are unique to that class  inheritance can be used to create a multiple level architecture of classes  in such an architecture even the bottom most subclasses inherit all of the attributes and behaviours that are defined in the very top most superclasses  this can save the programmer time because it renders unnecessary a lot of code duplication ,train

95,orig_taska.txt,a,-1,-1,in object oriented programming inheritance is a way to form new classes instances of which are called objects using classes that have already been defined the inheritance concept was invented in 1967 for simula  the new classes known as derived classes take over or inherit attributes and behavior of the pre existing classes which are referred to as base classes or ancestor classes  it is intended to help reuse existing code with little or no modification  inheritance provides the support for representation by categorization in computer languages categorization is a powerful mechanism number of information processing crucial to human learning by means of generalization what is known about specific entities is applied to a wider group given a belongs relation can be established and cognitive economy less information needs to be stored about each specific entity only its particularities  inheritance is also sometimes called generalization because the is a relationships represent a hierarchy between classes of objects for instance a fruit is a generalization of apple  orange  mango and many others one can consider fruit to be an abstraction of apple orange etc conversely since apples are fruit i e  an apple is a fruit  apples may naturally inherit all the properties common to all fruit such as being a fleshy container for the seed of a plant  an advantage of inheritance is that modules with sufficiently similar interfaces can share a lot of code reducing the complexity of the program inheritance therefore has another view a dual called polymorphism which describes many pieces of code being controlled by shared control code inheritance is typically accomplished either by overriding replacing one or more methods exposed by ancestor or by adding new methods to those exposed by an ancestor  complex inheritance or inheritance used within a design that is not sufficiently mature may lead to the yo yo problem ,orig

99,orig_taske.txt,e,-1,-1,in mathematics and computer science dynamic programming is a method of solving problems that exhibit the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure described below  the method takes much less time than naive methods the term was originally used in the 1940s by richard bellman to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another by 1953 he had refined this to the modern meaning the field was founded as a systems analysis and engineering topic that is recognized by the ieee bellman s contribution is remembered in the name of the bellman equation a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in recursive form the word programming in dynamic programming has no particular connection to computer programming at all and instead comes from the term mathematical programming  a synonym for optimization thus the program is the optimal plan for action that is produced for instance a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program programming in this sense means finding an acceptable plan of action an algorithm optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem for example the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices and then using this to pick the best overall path as shown in figure 1 in general we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three step process 1 break the problem into smaller subproblems 2 solve these problems optimally using this three step process recursively 3 use these optimal solutions to construct an optimal solution for the original problem the subproblems are themselves solved by dividing them into sub subproblems and so on until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant time figure 2 the subproblem graph for the fibonacci sequence that it is not a tree but a dag indicates overlapping subproblems to say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems for example in the fibonacci sequence f3  f1  f2 and f4  f2  f3  computing each number involves computing f2 because both f3 and f4 are needed to compute f5 a naive approach to computing f5 may end up computing f2 twice or more this applies whenever overlapping subproblems are present a naive approach may waste time recomputing optimal solutions to subproblems it has already solved in order to avoid this we instead save the solutions to problems we have already solved then if we need to solve the same problem later we can retrieve and reuse our already computed solution this approach is called memoization not memorization although this term also fits  if we are sure we won t need a particular solution anymore we can throw it away to save space in some cases we can even compute the solutions to subproblems we know that we ll need in advance ,orig
